# Ofqual Shutter Pages

## Introduction

This is a static site that is used whenever Ofqual needs to temporarily disable a website in the event of a problem

This site uses Vite to build a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS application, deploying out to an Azure Static Web App site

## Rules for use

- Adjustments to **content** should only be made in index.html for the Title and within the bounds of the content comment
- Adjustments to other aspects of the system (e.g. packages) should only be undertaken by a dedicated developer
- All changes must be submitted through the pull request system and preferably reviewed by another person
- All changes must pass a Snyk code scan without raising issues
